QUESTION:

496. Next Greater Element I
You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.

Ideas/thoughts:
initialiting a map,stack and iterating thru nums2, 
checking if stack exists and no in nums2 > last element in stack ,  create a map with key as last ele of stack and value as no.
remove last element of stack and append no to stack.

and iterate thru nums1 , if no is present in map , append value to ans from map.
or else return -1 if not found.
